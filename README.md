# Project 2 -- Full Stack Application 

Project #2: Job Applications Tracker

Link to live site: https://project2--app.herokuapp.com/

Functionality: Utilized all server routes to create fully functioning web application that keeps track of a users job applications. Utilized bcrypt and middleware to ensure safe entry into the app. Models, Controllers, and Views were all used in the created of this application. The database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas in which instead of pulling data from an API, the user can create data right into the database. Since the web app is hosted on the public web using a server it is hosted and deployed via Heroku. 

Technologies used: MongoDB, Node.js, Express/Expresss-sessions, Javascript, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, EJS, Bcrypt

Approach taken: My approach was that I wanted a site that could keep track of users job applications by allowing them to see all of their previous applications as well as create new ones. I created the schema so that the user could insert the link to the job app if they ever wanted to refer back to it. All server routes were used so that it qualified as a full CRUD application. 

Unsolved problems: There are many things that can be added to enhance the functionality of the app as well as add to the design of the site. The hardest part was relating the schemas.
